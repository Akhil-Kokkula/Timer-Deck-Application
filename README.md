# TimerApp

## Introduction
An application designed to help with all your timer needs. Inspired from the exercise routines written on whiteboards, users can now create their timer routine and this application would guide them to the completion of their goal. Another major factor that motivated me to build this application was that I found it difficult to find a well-designed application that would allow me to create my exercise routine and guide me through that routine.
