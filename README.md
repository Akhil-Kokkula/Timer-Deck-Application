# TimerApp

## Introduction
An application designed to help with all your timer needs. Inspired from the exercise routines written on whiteboards, users can now create their timer routine and this application would guide them to the completion of their goal. Another major factor that motivated me to build this application was that I found it difficult to find a well-designed application that would allow me to create my exercise routine and guide me through that routine. 

This application was created using Java in Android Studio Code. The frontend of the application is coded in XML.

## What I Learned?
- Learned to work with a database (SQLite)
- Understood the process of Android Development: working with fragments, activities, and adapters
- Overcame many challenges
  - Transitioning from timer set to screen with information of timer set
  - Populating items in Recycler View
  - Working on the timer  

## Next Steps
- Each card only accepts two tasks for now. Wish to allow the user to add as many tasks as possible
- Add edit and delete functionality for the cards within each timer set, and delete functionality for timer sets
- Can have a repition based and timer based mode, so that the user can have the option to add repititions for the tasks rather than being forced to write a time for each task
- Have audio to guide the user through the routine
